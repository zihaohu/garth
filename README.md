You'll need to change the `description`, `title` and `url` to match with the project.

## Page layouts

There are 3 layouts; `page`, `post` and `home` (home acts as the font page blog).

> **Note:** The Post List Page options are actually in the collection data within the `_config.yml` file, this is so they can be edited with CMSs such as [Siteleaf](https://siteleaf.com)
